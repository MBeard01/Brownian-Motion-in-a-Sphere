# Brownian-Motion-in-a-Sphere
A python project to simulate a ball (of any specified radius) moving randomly around a sphere to model Brownian motion



## Goals
- Model Brownian motion in a cube and in a sphere which contains a viscous fluid
- Create one model which is based on a point particle moving inside the enclosed surface, and another model based on a ball of specified mass and radius moving inside 
- Allow the freedom to specify as many constants as the user desires (e.g. mass and radius of the ball or viscosity of the fluid in which the particle moves)
- Create a system for solving the associated ODEs representing equations of motion by an iterative method
- Have the ability to create both plots and animations

  
## Languages
